# Sniper

A critical leaf identifier for Rule/Goal Graphs. Sniper inputs RGGs and outputs a sequence of leaves from the tree representing root-to-leaf paths which, if eliminated, result in a forest of subtrees not grounded in the original root. Such sequences of leaves are referred to as a collection of "critical leaves".
